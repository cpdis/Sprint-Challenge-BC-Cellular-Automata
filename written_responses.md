1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

A block is added to the blockchain if the hashed proof meets the requirements for a new proof and has not already been added to the blockchain.

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

Miners mine coins by trying to solve an arbitrarily difficult problem. If the miner solves the problem correctly, meets the set of requirements given by the proof, and hasn't already been found by another miner then the miner gets a coin.

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.

Conway's Game of Life could be used to model population growth by modifying the inputs, variables, and rules to account for different aspects of population growth. Generations could be modeled and growth or decline could be forecast.
